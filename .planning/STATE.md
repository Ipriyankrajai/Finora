## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6 phases following data-first architecture (Schema -> API -> UI -> Charts -> Polish)
- [Roadmap]: Money stored as integer cents to avoid floating-point precision errors
- [Roadmap]: Server-side aggregation for charts, client-side calculation for what-if simulation
- [01-01]: BigInt for money fields (safety margin over Int for large transactions)
- [01-01]: LoanPayment owns Transaction link (FK on LoanPayment, not Transaction)
- [01-01]: Single consolidated migration to resolve drift
- [01-02]: currency.js for display formatting (handles $, commas, negatives)
- [01-02]: PMT formula for amortizing loan calculations
- [01-02]: Infinity for monthsRemaining when payment doesn't cover interest
